# Chatbot

This is a chatbot for mathem based on their FAQ questions and answers, stored in `mathem.json`.
Ollama is required to be running locally (or configure a separate endpoint). Running ollama and a vector database locally is ofcourse very slow :) 

Install with poetry 
```poetry install```

Run with poetry as well
```poetry run python chat/main.py```
